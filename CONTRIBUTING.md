## About This Repository

Here's a quick overview of the technologies we use:

- **[PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces):** For managing monorepos.
- **[Tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/):** A TypeScript bundler for building the project.
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev):** Our testing framework.

## Development

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and start contributing to Monacopilot.

### Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [Monacopilot GitHub repository](https://github.com/arshad-yaseen/monacopilot).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Clone the Repository

Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arshad-yaseen/monacopilot.git
```

### Navigate to Project Directory

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd monacopilot
```

### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your work to keep changes organized:

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

### Install Dependencies

Monacopilot uses PNPM for managing dependencies. Install them by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Building the Package

To build the package, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command uses [Tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to bundle the project.

#### Alternative: Start Development Mode

For automatic rebuilds on file changes, start the watch mode with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This is useful for continuous development and testing.

## Testing Monacopilot Locally

To test Monacopilot locally, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    You need to set the [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) as an environment variable. Create a `.env.local` file in the `tests/ui` directory with the following content:

    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

    Replace `your_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

2. **Run the Test UI**

    Execute the following command to start the testing environment:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev:test-ui
    ```

    This will launch the UI in a local development environment, allowing you to test changes in real-time.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is essential.

- **Location:** The documentation is located within the `README.md` file at the root of the repository.
- **Format:** Documentation is written using Markdown.

### Viewing Documentation

To view the documentation, simply open the `README.md` file in your preferred text editor or view it directly on GitHub.

## Commit Conventions

Adhering to a consistent commit message format helps maintain a clear project history and facilitates collaboration.

**Commit Message Format:**

```plaintext
category(scope): message
```

**Categories:**

- `feat` / `feature`: Introduces new features or functionality.
- `fix`: Addresses and resolves bugs.
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
